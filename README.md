# Personal Website

This is the code for the website that I created using React. One weekend over the summer, I decided it would be fun to learn how to create my own website from scratch so I set about learning React. After following a YouTube tutorial in building a website for a fake company, I set about creating my own, writing all .js and .css files from scratch. It was a great experience and I learned a lot from this process!
